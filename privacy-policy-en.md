## 1. Data Collection
Our main commitment is to your privacy.
* **Personal Data:** We (the developers) **do not collect** and do not have access to direct personal information (such as name, email, ID) or the specific data you input to perform tasks within the Apps.
* **Usage and Advertising Data:** To keep our Apps free, we use third-party services (Google AdMob) that may collect anonymized technical data and your device's advertising identifiers to serve relevant ads.

## 2. Data Storage (User Input)
All data you manually enter or configure (such as preferences, calculations, notes, lists, and dates) is **saved exclusively on your device's internal memory**.
* **Control:** This information is never sent to AFS LifeApps servers.
* **Warning:** If you uninstall an App or clear the storage data in your device settings, your locally saved information will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.

## 3. Third-Party Services and Advertising
Our Apps may use **Google AdMob** to display advertisements. Google may use your device's advertising identifier, cookies, and similar technologies to collect data for:
* Serving personalized or non-personalized ads;
* Analyzing ad performance;
* Generating crash reports and system diagnostics.

For more details on how Google handles your data, please refer to the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## 4. Device Permissions
We may request system permissions specific to the functionality of each App. Generally:
