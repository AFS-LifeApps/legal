# Privacy Policy - AFS LifeApps

**Last updated:** December 29, 2024

**AFS LifeApps** develops applications focused on productivity and daily utility. This policy describes how we handle information in our apps (including, but not limited to, **Vacation Extender**).

## 1. Data Collection
Our applications operate under an "Offline-First" philosophy.
* **We (the developers) do not have access** to any data you enter.
* **We do not collect** personal information (name, email, phone).
* **We do not send** your data to external servers or our own cloud.

## 2. Data Storage
All data entered (such as registers, settings, and notes) is **stored exclusively on your device's internal memory**.
This ensures your information is available when you reopen the app, while keeping total control in your hands.
* **Warning:** If you uninstall the application or clear its storage data in your Android/iOS settings, this information will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered by us.

## 3. Device Permissions
We may request system permissions (such as notifications), but these are used solely for the app's local functionality and involve no data transmission.
